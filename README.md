# ktzzt
@ktzzt is a twitter handle I created to add missing functionality to twitter

# Purpose

The purpose of @ktzzt is to facilitate civil conversation on Twitter (et al.)

It works by using easily recognizable emoji-pairs to encode a longer message. The purpose of the longer message is to add context or sentiment to your tweet, while keeping your tweet focused and unnoisy.

# Why?
I invented ktztt, because I find that text is a difficult medium for conversation. Particularly, short text messages which we use for Internet conversations. There are several important social/conversational cues that get lost in text: vocal tone, mental context, facial expression. It is my observation that these missing cues make online conversations confusing, which leads to misunderstandings, which can fester into rage.

I want to find a way to make online conversations more civil and less aggressive. This is just one tool that I invented. Maybe people will find it useful.

People have already been trained how to use emojis to convey sentiment. 🤷 is generally accepted to say “I don’t know.”. I want to expand on that existing training with more specific messages.

# FAQ

The following are some anticipated frequently asked questions.

## Why not use hashtags?
I suppose hashtags are sometimes used for this same purpose that I am proposing with @ktzzt, but Twitter already uses hashtags in a different way, and I don’t want to interfere with that.

## Why should I use ktzzt?
1. For fun.
2. To be more clear with your communications.
3. You shouldn’t if you don’t want to.

## Where did you get the name ktzzt ?

1. It was the shortest meaningful twitter handle I could create.
2. [ZZT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZZT) is an old computer game that I spent hours of my childhood playing and programming. It was the first game made by the same company that makes Fortnite. 🍊📐 I’ve never played Fortnite: I need more practice  at FPS games, plus I feel that the freemium business model is fundamentally flawed.
3. Also, it’s fun to say “kut-zit”
